To choose a field on a board type in the row number first and the column number second.
You do not need any character or blank space in between.

If in tic tac toe the gravity is activated type only one number.
For checkers you additionally need to choose a direction. Add 'r' for right or 'l' for left. To move a king 'u' (up) or 'd' (down) needs to be the last character of your input.
